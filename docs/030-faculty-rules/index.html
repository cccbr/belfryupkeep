<a class=anchor href=#faculty-jurisdiction-rules>#</a></h1><p><img src=faculty-rules-title.jpg alt="Leonard Stanley, Gloucestershire"></p><blockquote class="book-hint danger">This chapter refers to activities carried out in churches within the jurisdiction of the Church of England. Ringers must remember that the Rules are set out in law, with possible penalties if they are not followed. Meeting the Rules is the responsibility of the Churchwardens and the Parochial Church Council, and ringers must use their specialist knowledge to assist the Church authorities in any application. Guidance should be sought from the Diocesan Secretary, The Diocesan Bell Advisor, and the local Guild or Association.</blockquote><p>Ringers are probably aware that a Faculty may be required prior to work being done in a Church of England Church. The faculty process exempts churches from listed building consent and conservation area consent that could apply elsewhere. When alterations are proposed, the parish must present the proposals to the archdeacon. For minor alterations, the archdeacon may authorise the work but more major projects will be judged by the Chancellor of the diocese, taking advice from specialists in the <a href=../170-glossary/#diocesan-advisory-committee-dac><em><strong>Diocesan Advisory Committee</strong></em></a>. The faculty is the legal authorisation of the work by the Chancellor.</p><p>The faculty system is a judicial system, so these notes reflect this style. Parishes and ringers intending do any work in their tower or on their bells must consider the full implications of the Rules.</p><h2 id=background>Background
<a class=anchor href=#background>#</a></h2><p>The Faculty Jurisdiction Rules 2015 were introduced with the intention of simplifying the faculty process and reducing the burden of administration, in particular for churchwardens and others in parishes with responsibility for church buildings. The major innovation of the 2015 Rules was the introduction of Lists A and B for items that could be undertaken without a faculty, subject to some general conditions stipulated in the Schedule.</p><p>A <a href=https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/Bells%20Guidance.pdf>useful guide</a> to the application of Lists A and B contains the following advice:</p><p><em>The works in List A may be undertaken without faculty and without informing your archdeacon. They are to allow for the routine maintenance and inspection of bells that are in regular use and where there is a tower captain, or other person, who has sufficient skills and knowledge to ensure that the work is done with due regard to health and safety and the protection of historically significant parts of the installation. List A does not permit work requiring a bell to be lifted from its bearings or making alterations to an installation</em>.</p><p><em>Works in List B require the Archdeacon to be consulted to confirm that a faculty is not needed. The Archdeacon will take advice from the DAC and its bells adviser before giving notice that the proposals may be undertaken without a faculty, or advising that they require a full faculty application</em>.</p><p><em>As with List A, these works should only be carried out by persons with sufficient skills and knowledge to complete the work to a satisfactory standard, with due regard to Health and Safety and the protection of historically significant parts of the installation. This may require a bellhanger to carry out or oversee the works</em>.</p><p><em>Although a series of relatively minor works may be all that is necessary to bring an installation back into use, the provisions of List B are principally for bells in regular use. If an installation is being brought back into use after a period of over 5 years a professional bell hanger must be consulted to see that all aspects of the ring are fit for use</em>.</p><p><em>List B cannot be used for works that require the removal of the bell from the belfry or for works that involve drilling, tuning, or other work that would make a lasting change to the bell</em>.</p><p>The Rules were amended in 2019 and again in 2022. The full version of the latest guidance is <a href=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/1184/article/20/made>here</a>.</p><h2 id=items-most-likely-to-be-of-relevance-for-ringers>Items Most Likely to be of Relevance for Ringers

Church clocks are included here because they are typically housed in the church tower and in many cases use the ringing bells as clock bells. Selected items from the <em>Church building</em> section which may be relevant to a Steeple Keeper are also included.</p><blockquote class="book-hint warning">Please note that, if you need to be involved in preparing a Faculty, the extracts below are not a substitute for the full document.</blockquote><h3 id=list-a>List A
